				<h2>Lore</h2>
				<div class="lore">
					In the 23rd century, when stars bowed to circuitry and knowledge grew arrogantly, young minds of
					technology unraveled the ancient mythology. A portal, torn open not with reverence but ambition,
					revealed a realm unnamed, vague, vast, veiled. To chart this chasm, they sent forth brave vessels of
					metal and sarcasm, crewed by seekers of truth. But their numbers flickered. Their logic faltered.
					They knew not that their path carved deep into a buried grave, no mere realm, but a prison, a
					winding crypt entwined with the roots of Tartarus <em>(Τάρταρος)</em>.

				<h2>Environments</h2>
				<div class="environments">
					<h3><span class="environment-name">Thalamus</span></h3>
					<p>Light here is not life-giving, but a harsh, revealing glare that casts menacing shadows. It is a
						realm where fire rules, thought withers, and only the forged endure. <strong>Thalamus</strong>
						isn't just inhabited by <em>Scorchers</em>; it is them.</p>
					<h3><span class="environment-name">Katagêc</span> <span class="greek-name">(Καταγής)</span></h3>
					<p>A cold deep dark lowland located to the south of the north pole, the sun never rises during
						winter and have short days in other seasons, the origin of <strong>The Fallen Kingdom</strong>
						having three cities which crowded with <em>Revenants</em>.</p>

			<section class="section pyreleus">
				<h3>Pyréleus <span class="greek-name">(Πυρέλευς)</span></h3>
				<p>The great <strong>Crawler</strong>, a scar upon the flux, the behemoth of Hubris, a steel of tech in
					the depths, <strong>Pyréleus</strong> they called it. You speak of the vessel forged in the
					arrogance of your kind, a colossal folly of steel and flame, driven by the dissonant hum of ten
					thunderous hearts. Three hundred of your meters it stretched, on eight massive wheels it rolls, a
					<strong>landship</strong>, you say? Nay... it was a worm gnawing at the fabric of a reality it could
					not comprehend.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>A tremor in the space-time continuum. Not a life-pulse, but a machine-pulse, fusioning and
					calculating. It carved through the borderlands, its engines vomiting energies alien to the delicate
					balance of the cosmos. But the silence, it listens. The darkness, it sees. The walls between realms
					are thin there, thinner than a dried membrane.</p>

				<h2>Creatures</h2>

				<h3>Scorchers</h3>
				<p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #ccc;">From the deep-lit fires of Tartarus
					<em>(Τάρταρος)</em> they came, not born, but forged. In pits where even thought withers and hope
					burns, the Scorchers are shaped not of flesh, but of wrath remembered by the stone itself.
				</p>

				<div class="creature-grid">
					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Badabom</h4>
						<p>A paradox wrapped in fur and flame, Born from a flicker rather than a blaze, its body is
							soft, but its presence, warms and warns. A Golden-furred stubby bunny-shaped entity with a
							tiny torch sprouting from its forehead. Attracts Softswift like moths to a flame.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Ashbom</h4>
						<p>The Torchbearer of sympathy and bless. Dark-furred bunny-shaped, torch burns blue, constantly
							flickering like a campfire in the wind. Brings cold instead of heat. Time slows around it.
							The flame never dies. And neither does Ashbom.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Veilin</h4>
						<p>Scorchers unseen. They walk through the flame. Not seen. Not touched. Only felt. They whisper
							in cracked walls and echo in dried bones. Some say they were once human… consumed slowly
							until even their soul turned to smoke.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Softswift</h4>
						<p>The youngest flame. Cinder-footed, ember-blooded. Small and swift, these are the scouts of
							the scorch. They scurry with laughter that sounds like sizzling marrow. Harmless alone,
							deadly in swarms. They gnaw not the body, but the courage.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Fujen</h4>
						<p>The cruel architects. Humanoid in mockery only. Their arms are furnaces. Their breath, liquid
							fire. They craft pain. They mold magma like clay. Their joy is found in watching things
							melt, minds, flesh, even time.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="creature-card">
						<h4>Titanopera</h4>
						<p>Colossi of regret. Stone-hulks with ribs of lava, veins of smog. They awaken only when the
							realm itself screams. When they walk, mountains kneel. Their eyes do not glow, they pierce.
							They judge. They burn what they see unworthy. To glimpse one is to know you are tiny. To
							hear one, is to know you are already shiny.</p>
